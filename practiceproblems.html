HTML, CSS and Javascript
For this section, you will be recreating a simple HTML page. You will demonstrate your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as with Network Requests.
In a single HTML file:
1. Write HTML tags for all of the elements you see in the images
2. Style the HTML elements using CSS according to what you see in the images
3. Write Javascript code that will handle Network Requests and DOM Manipulation. 

Network requests should be done using the Fetch API. You can read up on it at: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API

Do not use external libraries. Keep it vanilla.

Helpful Information:
CSS:
1. The buttons are the same color as the background. Use a 1px solid gray border with a 2px radius.
Javascript:
1. Clicking "Send A Post" should send an http POST request to a fake website: "www.test.voyager.com/name". Since the website is fake, assume that it responds with "Hello [inputted name], great work so far!". Display the response as shown in the images below.
2. Clicking "Grab A Video" should create a new card and inject it into the page. To get the video, you must send an http GET request to "www.test.voyager.com/video" (also a fake website). Since the website is fake, assume that it responds with a link to a youtube video (you may choose any video link). This video will also be injected into the page along with the card.
3. As a reminder: you must use the Fetch API. Even though the requests will fail, you must still write the code as if they will succeed.
